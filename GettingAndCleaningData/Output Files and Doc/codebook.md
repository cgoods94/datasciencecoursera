### Raw Data Source

The raw data comes from experiments on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones conducted
at Universit√† degli Studi di Genova in Genoa, Italy. UC Irvine's Web page for this dataset can
be found [here,](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
while the .zip file of said data can be found [here.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

**IMPORTANT:** 

### Overview

The experiments that yielded this data involved 30 subjects (ages 19-48) performing six different activities
(WALKING on a level plane, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING down)
while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. The Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone has an
embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, making it able to capture 3-dimensional linear acceleration and angular
velocity. The signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope were also processed to yield variables in the time 
and frequency domains.

### Variable Name Format

There are two forms for the descriptive variable names in the tidy data set.

Axial variables will end with an X, Y, or Z and take the following form:

\[Domain\]\[Measurement\]\[StatisticalValue \]\[Axis\]

Magnitude variables, which are derived from the three axial variables take a slightly different form:

\[Domain\]\[Measurement\]\[Mag\]\[statistical value\]
